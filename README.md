# NetworkedGeiger
A project to create a networked Geiger Counter based on Arduino Nano Pro

Basically this is a hardware project. The goal is to familiarize myself with Geiger Counters and to learn coding (interrupts etc).

The idea is to have a DIY Geiger differing in following aspects:
  - Is networked by the Ethernet wire (security through obscurity, I do not like the idea od IoT over WiFi)
  - syslog, mqtt and http het/put methods can be tested
  - the device has an RTC (I plan to use RTC instead of millis().
